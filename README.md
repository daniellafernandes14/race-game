# Race-Game

Easy 2 player game where each player chooses a car and races to get it to the finish line!
<br>Using JS EventListeners, I have built a game that reacts to a user pressing a letter on the keyboard to move their chosen car.
<br>Once the game is complete, an alert shows the winner, a counter that tracks the game shows how many points each player now has, and the game starts again.
